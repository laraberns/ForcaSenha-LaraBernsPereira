# Password Strength Checker Application

This project is a simple web application that checks the strength of a user's password and provides feedback on whether it is strong, moderate, or weak. It was built using JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.

## Features

### Password Strength Rules

The password strength checker is based on the following rules:

- If the password has more than 1 character - 1 point.
- If the password has more than 6 characters - 2 points.
- If the password has 10 or more characters - 3 points.
- If the password has 12 or more characters - 4 points.
- If the password has 14 or more characters - 5 points.
- If the password contains at least one number - +1 point.
- If the password contains at least one uppercase letter - +1 point.
- If the password contains at least one lowercase letter - +1 point.
- If the password contains at least one special character (non-alphanumeric) - +2 points.
- Total possible points: 10.

### Password Strength Levels

The password is categorized into the following levels based on the total points:

- "Strong" if the password scores 9 or more points.
- "Moderate" if the password scores more than 5 but less than 9 points.
- "Weak" if the password scores 5 or fewer points.

### Password Visibility Toggle

Users can switch between password visibility options, allowing them to show or hide the characters they type.

### Real-time Strength Progression

As users type their password, the application displays the password's strength progression in real-time, giving instant feedback on the password's strength.
